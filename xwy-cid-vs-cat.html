Guys, I'm so freaking happy with my most recent haul from TB. Maybe this is the best one I've done yet. I bought 15 items in total, lots of jewelry, shoes, some clothes and some household item I will review part of it. Mainly because the other part is unbranded clothing. I'm also just too excited to share jewelry find with you guys since I found a lot of inspiration from this reddit. My accuracy rating is going to be higher than normal because I don't see most of the auth IRL. Bonus point Hello ladies! Here's a few things I've come across recently. I love browsing taobao on my spare time, so feel free to leave any suggestions bellow. I haven't bought anything on this list, t so make sure to check reviews and/or ask for the help of an agent if you want to know whether anything is branded etc. Happy shopping!
