                            <p> Hey there fellow gamers. I'm a small YouTube channel known as TheHalfGlassOfWater, I have just over 620 subscribers. My small success has been from Posting skits and gmvs I've created on a browser based game call Graal Classic Online. I've been gone for a year from posting now, but want to get back into it. Playing graal and making content for that I can do on my own or with help if interested. But looking for collaborations on other games and or with Gmod, as I've recently become interested. Hello, this sub-reddit is dedicated to people who wants to publicly share their information without getting interrupted by the mod. This sub-reddit will allow: \- Warn/ban complaints \- Good/bad experience with Graal \- Complain about staff/mods \- Meme-ing/call out other users \- Anything RELATED to Graal If this thread gets exposed to the outer world, it will be pretty cancerous, but I'm sick of Graal admins blindfolding users about their experience. Let us hear it. Rules of this sub-re. Hey /r/gaming. I need some advice. My girlfriend is in the hospital right now due to complications with our pregnancy. She is going to be in there for another seven weeks which is pretty devastating for someone who hates hospitals as much her. I know that games are a great way to pass the time but I'm more of a console/pc gamer that plays mostly games like GTA, fallout, skryim, etc so I am of little help. Also, the only things she has with her are an iPad and and a Mac Book Pro. I would. 
Hello, back than as a little kid my second MMO I ever played after Graal Online was Runescape. It caught me pretty fast. Not because of "BlueRose" was the only one at that time who could smith Rune Armor, it was about the PVP System. It was the "WILDERNESS". All my dreams became true there. It was basically an area on the map where pvp is automatically enabled when you step into it. There were harder mobs, better loot, better xp farming spots and you could lose all your stuff in the inventory. Some time ago I created a post looking for help about winter bouldering in Varazze (https://www.reddit.com/r/bouldering/comments/9qpamx/advice_for_winter_bouldering_in_varazze/) \- I haven't had any experience with winter bouldering before and bouldering being quite niche sport, I wasn't able to find all-things-Varazze-bouldering in one place (or at least in English), so I had to do quite a bit of research to prepare myself for the climbing trip and figured I might as well share what I've learn. Hi, I'm looking for an MMORPG that will not heat up my laptop (would low spec MMORPGS prevent this?) as my laptop will get annoyingly loud, which ruins immersion for me (I hate headphones, my ears sweat like hell) and I'm scared of melting my graphics card (my friend melted his). The only MMOs I've played were on the mobile phone and I want a taste in PC gaming for once. Also has to be free to play and no turn based. Games I've played (mostly mobile): Celtic Heroes (loved socializing. So a small introduction: At the beginning I wasn’t really interested in mobile MMORPGs, I guess I was a “hardcore” player pretty much and I’m afraid that most of mobile mmorpgs are casual and full of crap. Then I saw that a MMO (currently in beta; Life is Feudal) has a very interesting idea. An android application that is separate from the main MMO and it has many mini games from which you can keep the score and then use it in the actual MMO game for faster gathering etc. Unfortunately GraalOnline Classic is an MMORPG with a retro\-look. Play with hundreds of players worldwide, explore the world, and use various weapons and tools. Customize your character, make friends, form guilds, explore, quest, build a house, and more! Much of the material in GraalOnline Classic is derived from the hit 1991 game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  However, GraalOnline was developed throughout early 1998 and became a whole new separate game. Currently, it is available on IOS, Androi. Hey, gamers, long time browser of this MMO community. I share many of your opinions about recent MMOs, and I'm just wondering what your go-to game is and what MMOs are keeping you interested nowadays. As far as my tastes, I'm looking for a non-p2w open world MMORPG with fluid combat and a strong, extremely large, friendly community. As far as my tastes, I have an opinion on a few recent MMOs. Guardian Hunter is shit. StarCraft Universe is shit. Ironsight is shit. Star Citizen is shit. Do you love discord, and GraalOnline? Well, I have made the perfect place for you! Here you can chat with anyone that plays GraalOnline! We have GraalOnline Playerworlds, delteria, era, classic, zone, and ol' west! Come join! The link is right here: https://discord.gg/SAsCX96. 
For almost 10 years the hidden gem Graal Online has been my home. I've made friends, enemies, money and shared laughs all around. As of late, since around 2010, there's been a steady decline in players and the servers are slowly starting to die, which is a total travesty! This game has been underrated and shunned by many people who weren't willing to give it a try when they didn't realize that it was a pioneer in so many ways. The sad reality is that since the development i need help creating an OpenAi in Graal Online Classic in Facebook gameroom which can Figth Automaticly and Farm automaticlly Hello there, if you're reading this, it's because I am trying to save a dying game. The reason it's dying is not because the game is bad or has a cash shop, it's the staff behind it. The game is called GraalOnline, so of you may have heard of it. This is one of the few classic MMORPG's out there that has been made from the ground up by the players itself. I mean this sincerely, most content you see on this game is made by players and has been implemented via an upload system. But that's I am trying to create a bot for an MMO called "Graal Online Classic" with Pyautogui. It would read the "PM" of a player who messages them, then reply with the appropriate response. It would also take a screenshot of the players name, converts it to a string with tesseract, and store it in a dictionary(and also store where that particular player is in the bot's response hierarchy) and use that to determine if the player had messaged them before. def player_id(name_coords, option): # Indentif. ##2D MMORPGS## ------------------------------------------- AeonRivals (https://aeonrivals.com/) Ashen Empire ( Astonia Reborn ( gtA private server reboot Bones-Underground ( gtA private server for Endless Online Delta Tao's Clan Lord (https://www.deltatao.com/clanlord/) Dark Story (spanish?) (https://bravewolfdev.com/foro/showthread.php?tid=302) DarkStory Alt Link (https://www.indiedb.com/. Pretty simple enough I guess. We all love Link for his green garb and his heroic epics, but what are some games that don't feature Link that a Zelda fan could enjoy? This could be anything from similar gameplay, to story, or even just the characters. There's the obvious games like Okami, with it's character design and gameplay style, that a lot of people know about. Are there any obscure games that you can think of? EDIT Thanks everyone for the awesome discussion! Hopefully people Hey guys! Like some of you I got a MOGA Ace Controller for my iPhone 5 for Christmas! Yay! And like some of you I noticed that there's next to no mention in the App Store about games that are compatible. And both MOGA's and Logitech's websites say something to the air of "Here are some games and there are tons more!" So I'm gonna keep this list going with any and all games I find that are compatible. With App Store links. If you find any that aren't on the list please say something There is an mmo based on link to the past which has been going for years now. The name is Graal Online: Classic. You can play it for free on Facebook, iOS and Android today. 
Hello friends. Apologies for the time span since my last post. Someone recently told me they hoped I was still working on this game, and it made me realize how long it has been since I posted. I am definitely still working on this game, and although the amount of work I put into it is dependant on everything from free time to being in the mood for programming, I usually work towards it on a daily basis in at least a small way. One reason I haven't updated recently is the lack of interesting. </p>
