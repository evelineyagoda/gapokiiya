                            <p>-Откройте PARAM.SFO файл, используя PARAM_SFO_Editor.exe. Когда программа загрузится, нажмите на изображение чёрной папки и укажите путь до файла PARAM.SFO, после, вы увидите всю, необходимую информацию об игре.  Хороший диск!!!В принципе всё самое необходимое для ps2 на нём есть!Не знаю актуально ли это вообще,просто я немного видоизменил этот диск(может кому пригодится),только не знаю как тут. · Krogot, ну в принципе да, если прошивка старая то я бы сначала поставил ту версию что стоит а потом уже обновился бы до последнего ребага. Hi all, Have any of you successfully managed to change the game title and how it appears on the PS4 main menu when you change it using the Param.SFO editor? I've tried to do this by altering the sfo for each game title on the PS4 internal hard drive via FTP once the game has been installed, but it doesn't seem to work. Any ideas. Does anyone know how to add the parameter to the param.sfo for a ps3 game to remote play to ps vita. I use the ps3tools param.sfo editor when I add it the game crashes when trying I mainly just want the PARAM.SFO editor but the only ones I can find are the outdated ones from 10 years ago and the ones you can only get from Aldo’s tools. No matter where I download it from, whether it’s a zip or a exe, it deletes as soon as it’s opened or even as soon as it’s downloaded. I can’t find any help on Google. Someone please help me, or a link to the SFO editor inlcuded in the Tools package will be fine since that’s all I really. 
So i recently sold my copy of skyrim since i got my ps3 jailbroken. But i really wanted to continue playing it, so i downloaded it. At first it did not recognized my saved files, but after i changed the game region with param sfo editor and the other apps, it finally found them. However after loading, them, it says the savegame is outdated, and cannot be loaded. Is there a way to change the version number of a savegame like it is possible to change the savegame region? Or maybe downgrading Hi everytime i try to use cfw2ofw it downloads the patch creates does the first 2 steps of Processing game files and when it goes to Patching PARAM.SFO it fails every time and says "Access to the path 'PATH' is denied" Can someone help me with this please. UPDATE: After i opened PARAM.SFO with PARAM.SFO editor and just saved it, it finaly patched the file when i started CFW2OFW. Is this possible? I utilized the PARAM.SFO Editor (two different ones), though each time it either shows up as corrupt data or doesn't allow me to boot into the game - "An error has occured.". Anyone have any luck or can help out? Update - PARAM.SFO Editor Setup (http://imgur.com/a/Pgfue). In this tutorial i will explain how to use PS3-ISO-Rebuilder to rebuild a PS3 ISO or JB Folder so that it is a 1:1 backup of an original disc. You can do this with any PS3 disc game, provided you have the right files. # Downloads amp Links PS3-ISO-Rebuilder (https://mega.nz/#!xbAnEIwY!p_ugNRR78duW4YzDt7ysPhFiT1m2r4I5mZb85L9xJcQ "Software for comparing ISO files with IRD files") PS3_DISC.SFB edit (https://mega.nz/#!oCB32IwK!C-ZAm_AeaF9wm9pAsCl1WRetaCRZTmQ_N6ARQvnF4_o. I finally found a way how to change PSP ISO title (not file name) in XMB when Hide PIC0.PNG and PIC1.PNG in game menu is Enabled . I was annoyed by ugly titles like this one: (My perfectionism is out of control.) So let's do it! Download my pack: https://mega.nz/#!h8hQBC5J!H8IxtMmXvmq5yA14euPgawV0IA3k1k2oGRX85W8d6Xg Launch UMDGen, click Open and select ISO. Open PARAM_SFO_Editor and close. Now UMDGen knows how to open PARAM.SFO Would anyone be able to create a exe version of this tool: https://github.com/BuXXe/PARAM.PFD-PS3-Demons-Souls-Savegame-Tool it uses python, and sadly I have zero experience using it any help is much appreciated. title. 
If you've bought or NPS'd G-Generation Genesis in Asia English (PCSH00242) and its DLC suite, you've probably noticed that "GGGENESISDLC0011" is missing from the addcont/TITLE_ID folder after you've completed the installation. Some sleuthing around over the past few days led me to find that this DLC, containing two Mobile Suits from Char's Deleted Affair, was never actually released in the Asia region. I attempted to remedy this by NPSing the corresponding Japan region DLC package (PCSG00793_00. This guide will walk you through how to transfer data between the PSP and PC versions of Zero no Kiseki or Ao no Kiseki. Please note that the Japanese version of Zero no Kiseki PC is incompatible with this method, as the format of the save files are modified. If you have game executables based on the older Chinese version of Zero no Kiseki or all versions of Ao no Kiseki , they are compatible with this method. To verify that your PC save data of Zero no Kiseki is compatible they are not working i used the new maidump tool to install the games but whenever i try to open them they ask me to update my system to 3.65. i am not using enso just the regular henkaku is this the problem ? thanks in advance Edit: here is a screenshot https://imgur.com/a/OOU3O i tried val-11 hall-a and undertale both doesn't work Edit 2 : looks like you have to edit the game param.sfo on your pc just use SFO Editor then load the game param.sfo if you are connected with usb then change. 
Hi everyone, so I've been on this mission for quite some time now. I am a huge grown-up Skate 3 fanboy and a couple of weeks ago the fever came back, so I took my PS3 out of the closet, updated to Rebug 4.82.2_REX and updated MultiMan. I put a US (BLUS30464) and EU (BLES00760) version on my HDD along with some DLC's. Some DLC I have for US and some for EU. After hours and hours of trying, all I get is the "downloadable content not working.please re-install" error message during Ridge Racer Custom DLC Music Steps: 1. Select an unused Slot from the 30000~39999 range of DLC folders. a. If you own all of the DLC music legit, the first available slot is 0000000000030091. 2. Copy an existing decrypted music DLC directory and rename it to 0000000000030091. 3. Rename `BGM##DB.bin` to your unused slot `BGM91DB.bin`. 4. Rename `BGM##.nus3bank` to your unused slot `BGM91.nus3bank` 5. Use `runext.exe` to launch the `Ridge Racer BGMDB Editor` and open `BGM91DB.bin` At first I was looking for a simple direct launcher, but it seems that since this causes far too many issues for some games, that's not ideal. It also would make these games unplayable online. I've seen images of BD selectors and other options, but I haven't been able to find enough info on those. webMan is a wonderful solution to this problem by running browser commands via XML, but this limits what it can display. Personally, I like the look of the XMB icons and their background pictures. So first and foremost, I did not discover this myself, but /u/ImNotASWFanboy brought it to my attention that not many people know how to do this. Things you will need: A PS3 Some sort of external memory device Bruteforce Save Editor ( Gibbed Save Editor (ME2 or ME2) Windows OS or some way to run windows program on another OS. On the PS3 dashboard, go to PS3 Saved data utility under games and find the save you want to use. Press the triangle. 
So before I begin, I wanted to note that I was following the HackInformer ( guide on creating custom bubbles, and then I got stuck with questions that I couldn't find the answers to. First is that in the example given they are using VitaFTP. There's no problem with that, but I get stuck on Part 2 - Step 2 which mentions, gt Delete the PARAM.SFO and rename DATA.PSP to DATA.PSAR. So I have an Asian Skyrim and I needed to buy a european copy. I worked a lot on my save so I was looking to switch it to european. I have edited the param and stuff manually. I couldn't start the copy process and it gave me a corrupted save file without the image of the save or the correct size on the usb. I then used the PS3 SFO editor to do it, but this time it gave me the correct game image and size, but as soon as it starts copying it tells me its corrupted and gives me the error code 80010. </p>
