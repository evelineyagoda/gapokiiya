                            <p> When will they release or update their I've seen people speculating about when TOTS will come out, So I've spent a very long time gathering info from various years of TOTS to give you everything you need to have the best idea to when TOTS will release in FIFA 19. FIFA 18 TOTS was announced April 15th during the FIFAeWorldCup live stream, they stated that tots would come out April 27th and would be voted by the community via Futwiz and Futbin. TOTS most consistent, aka "Community TOTS" came out Friday, April 27th, along Edit for the people throwing personal insults at me: I would like to point out that you guys wanted me to be more prominent in the community and get feedback over to EA. We're going from the worst FIFA I've ever played besides 16 to a game that feels good so far in my personal opinion. If you think me liking something makes me a sell out, there's nothing I can do about that. I will continue to be positive and critical when appropriate, just as I have in the past. I'm not changing I have a question for you all, is there a way i can import my Fifa 19 club from the web app to a page lige futwiz, futbin or futhead? Mainly to check which sbcs i can do.

The bold players are those who have been 'locked in' by the community member. Please feel free to update me if any of these changes or I made some mistake, I hope to keep this updated as we draw closer to the final voting on Friday. TOTY Community Member Voting (https://d.
